# OCR-using-Pytesseract
This uses a simple webpage which extracts text data from images using OCR.

Our idea uses OCR technology and a basic webpage to simplify the
process of checking health insurance applications.
Individuals upload images of their identity cards.
PyTesseract is a clever tool that can read dates of birth
and other important information like PAN and Aadhar numbers.
Then, this information is displayed properly on our user-friendly website.
It facilitates the employeeâ€™s quick access to customer data.
Our goal is to make the insurance application process quick, reliable,
and simple so that everyone is satisfied.
